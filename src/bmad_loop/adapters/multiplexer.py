"""Terminal-multiplexer seam.

The coding-CLI adapter (:class:`~.base.CodingCLIAdapter`) abstracts *which CLI*
to drive and how its prompts/hooks work. This module abstracts the orthogonal
**transport** axis: how sessions, windows, and panes are created, observed, and
torn down. The bundled backends are tmux
(:class:`~.tmux_backend.TmuxMultiplexer`) and the native-Windows psmux
(:class:`~.psmux_backend.PsmuxMultiplexer`); every other backend lives out-of-tree
(the reference is the herdr adapter, https://github.com/pbean/bmad-loop-adapter-herdr)
and slots in without the rest of the codebase shelling out to ``tmux`` directly.

``TerminalMultiplexer`` is the contract a backend author implements. Operation
names mirror today's call sites verbatim so the migration is mechanical. Backends
register themselves through :func:`register_multiplexer` (bundled ones from
:func:`_load_builtin_backends`; out-of-tree ones at import time, triggered by the
``bmad_loop.mux_backends`` entry-point scan in :func:`_load_external_backends` —
so a pip/uv co-installed adapter package is selectable with no config step); the
process-wide backend is selected by registry and returned by :func:`get_multiplexer`.

Selection precedence (issue #87): the ``BMAD_LOOP_MUX_BACKEND`` env var, then the
policy ``[mux] backend`` choice (installed once per CLI invocation via
:func:`configure_multiplexer`), then the platform default when registered and
available, then the first registered backend that matches the platform and is
available, then the historical fallback (first platform match regardless of
availability, bottoming out at tmux). :func:`detect_multiplexers` enumerates the
registry for ``bmad-loop mux`` and the ``validate`` preflight.
